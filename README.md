# MVC Lecture
This project is a presentation on MVC for beginner programmers. It covers what is MVC, why it's important, how to use an MVC format in your code, and shows step-by-step through code examples what happens when different CRUD requests are made. The project also uses a "to do" list template in MVC format.

## How It's Made

**Tech used:** Client side HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, EJS, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose, and Nodemon. 

This "to do" list template was modified for it to run locally. 

## Optimizations
I will continue to improve this project by adding commented lines of code to aid in the audience's understanding as well as refactor areas as needed. 

## Lessons Learned
I learned how to explain MVC in a simple, easy to understand way for my audience as well as modify areas so that the project could run locally.
